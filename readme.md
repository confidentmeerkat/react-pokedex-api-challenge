# Pokedex API Challenge
Ash and his friends are on a new adventure to catch even more Pokemon!  Before they 
set off on this journey they need some tools.  As we all know every great Pokemon 
trainer needs a reliable Pokedex to identify Pokemon.  Itâ€™s a good thing they have you!  
Ash has asked if you would be willing to build him a brand new Pokedex with core 
features and a couple of enhancements.
